Each of them were working on their own individual projects, feeling isolated, uninspired, and a bit chaotic juggling a new city, a new country, a new language, family, oh and that thing called their career. Through facing these challenges they created a place where everyone feels welcome, uniqueness is a virtue, and is flexible for all lifestyles: Jam Workspace.</p><p>The flagship location opens October 2014 in Amsterdam Zuid (South), to inspire and engage those looking to create the work they desire in a supportive and flexible environment.</p><p>Each woman brings a special pizzazz, and background to the team!! After meeting them, you will get it!! The uniqueness of each co-founder has been instrumental in creating the amazing space that Jam Workspace is.</p><h2>Katie Passos Co-Founder</h2><p>Marriage, children and then an adventure. After ten years working for the same organisation, settling down with a good man and becoming a mother it was time for something different and broader horizons for the Passos family. With children young enough to move and a work-life balance not balancing the decision to move to Amsterdam was an easy one. They packed their bags, said their goodbyes to family and friends and embraked on a new chapter in their lives.</p><p>After a period of readjustment it was time for Katie to look for something extra to supporting her family and making some amazing home-cooked dinners. Meeting Kirsty and Paz was the turning point and the seed of the difficulty of professionls that need to connect and blah re-write</p><h2>Kirsty Weir Co-Founder</h2><p>Bio will be available shortly...</p><h2>Paz Chentnik Co-Founder</h2><p>Married her high school sweetheart, bought a house, and had two kids by 28. After having the American Dream her and her husband realized they wanted to sell it all and travel the world as a family. Over the next year, they sold most of their belongings, rented their house and moved to China with a 1 & 3 yr old. Over the next three years they lived across the globe (Malaysia, China, Thailand, Mexico, & South Carolina, U.S.A.) and created an online income through E-commerce businesses and her husband worked remotely for an American Company.</p><p>One hot afternoon in Mexico they decided that although they loved their flexible globe trotting lifestyle they were a bit bored only working with each other and constant travel made it hard to be apart of a community, after much research they decided to relocate to Amsterdam.</p><p>After two months living in Amsterdam and meeting the other two lady co-founders they knew that Amsterdam was a city they could call home for more than 6 months. While trying to grow their Educational Ebook business she noticed that even in a city like Amsterdam there was no place to grow and connect that was flexible to a mother’s lifestyle or child friendly. Having two young children 4 & 6 this was a problem.</p><p>Now she spends her days split between motherly duties, Master Mind Groups, sharing the vision of Jam Workspace, and ensuring the community at Jam Workspace is inviting, encouraging, and fun!</p></div>").partial("partials/partial-footer",ctx,null);}return body_0;})();
